    <h3>Lasagna Recipe</h3>
    <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong><p>with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses</strong>
            <p>We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesanâ€”like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</p></li>
            <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job</strong><p>A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!
</strong></li>
        </ol>
