        About Vada Pav
    </h1>
    <p>
        Vada Pav is sold in shops, outside of schools and colleges all over Mumbai because it is so popular and loved by street food lovers.

It is one of the most humble street foods in Mumbai, yet it is tasty and delicious. Vada pav basically has Batata Vada which is sandwiched between two slices of a pav (fluffy dinner roll) topped with sweet chutney, green chutney, and dry garlic chutney.

Batata vada are fried batter coated potato dumpling fritters. The batter is made with nutty gram flour (besan) and spices. The filling consist of savory, spiced mashed potatoes.

Batata means potato in Marathi language. While the term vada mostly means a fried fritter or a fried dumpling-like savory dish.

Throughout my childhood, I ate vada pav in many places in Mumbai and it was always so delicious! Even today I still make sure that I buy vada pav whenever I visit Mumbai. However, when I am craving vada pav and can’t get to Mumbai, so I make them at home.

Pav means a small loaf or bun of bread in Indian and is the same as dinner rolls. They are made with all purpose flour or whole wheat flour and can be bought from bakeries, super stores and sweet shops in India.

Vada pav can be eaten during any time of the day like breakfast, brunch, or in the evening as a snack. It goes very well with Indian chai, fried green chilies, and chutney like coriander chutney or mint chutney or green chutney or any chutney of your choice.
